POISSON DISTRIBUTION OF BRIGANDS
Measure: Time between seeing brigands. 
Naive hypothesis: Brigands appear and disappear  randomly
Null hypothesis: Brigands are generated at a consistent time, and do not disappear until reaching a new island.
Proposed hypothsis: Brigands functionas above, but encounters follow Poisson distribution.
