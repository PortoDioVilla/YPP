All the work I've done programming, optimizing, codifying, algorthimystifying and manually entering Puzzle Pirates data!
Databases contains the spreadsheets from which information is drawn by other programs.
TradeCoordinator is a package that includes several subclasses with widely varying functions. Some for GUI, some for algorithim, coordination, data generation etc.
Much more to be added, pilfered from a recent project I did in CSC207: Principles of Software Design.
Also, many media files I "borrow" from 3 Rings to represent their ingame things.

Fixed Goals:
-All spreadsheets as SQL database(s)
-Functionality to generate a new trade deal between two islands, using info about capital, income, resources(ships, stalls, lackies, threats, islands, bids etc)
-Functionality to record a successful deal, with automatic updating of capital and other info (ship position, etc)
-Generatable speculation on future deals, route safety, price changes, shoppes entering the market
-Generatable speculation on deadlines, deal completion, "dry" spells, etc
-Documentation of algorithim design, correctness, and computational cost
-Documentation of numerical method implementation, rationale, effect, progress vectors
-Vibrant and streamlined UI that facilitates users making the above deals, as well as recording data and generating targetted speculation
-Full summative report on the skills, techniques, and knowledge used to create and complete this project, to bolster my resume.
